# shinylive deploy config for GitHub Pages
# This file tells GitHub Pages to serve the app from the shinylive/ directory

# If you use the default export, shinylive/ will contain index.html and all assets
# You can access your app at https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/shinylive/

# No further configuration is needed for static hosting, but you can add a README

# To export your app, run in R:
# shinylive::export(".", output_dir = "shinylive")

# Then commit and push the shinylive/ folder to your repository

# Optionally, you can add a .nojekyll file to prevent GitHub Pages from ignoring files/folders that start with _
